Within this repository, you'll find three innovative projects that leverage advanced techniques in feature selection and 
employ a variety of machine learning models to predict outcomes with precision. Let's delve into the specifics of each: 

1.) Titanic Simulation: This project employs machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Classification (SVC) 
cross-validation, Random Forest cross-validation, and Logistic Regression cross-validation. Its goal is to predict the 
survival outcomes of individuals on the Titanic based on distinct features. By leveraging these methodologies, the model 
endeavors to provide insights into the factors influencing survival probabilities.

2.) 2022 World Cup Prediction Model: Utilizing the Random Forest technique with cross-validation, this project aims to 
predict the winner of the 2022 World Cup. Through the analysis of extensive big data containing a significant array of 
metrics, the model endeavors to offer informed predictions regarding the outcomes of one of the world's most prominent 
sporting events.

3.) S&P 500 Price Prediction Model: Employing a diverse array of machine learning techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares 
Regression, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Model, and Time Series Model, this 
project seeks to predict the price of the S&P 500 index. Grounded in historical data, the model incorporates a comprehensive 
set of both economic and non-economic predictors to offer nuanced insights into potential price movements.
